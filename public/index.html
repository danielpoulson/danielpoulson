          The Road Not Taken
        </h1>
        <span class="card-subtitle">Robert Frost - 1874-1963</span>
        <div class="poem__body">
          <p>
            <span class="long-line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And sorry I could not travel both</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And be one traveler, long I stood</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And looked down one as far as I could</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >To where it bent in the undergrowth;</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="long-line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And having perhaps the better claim,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Though as for that the passing there</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Had worn them really about the same,</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="long-line">And both that morning equally lay</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >In leaves no step had trodden black.</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Oh, I kept the first for another day!</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >I doubted if I should ever come back.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="long-line">I shall be telling this with a sigh</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >I took the one less traveled by,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And that has made all the difference.</span
            >

          <p>To my dearest Kate</p>
          <p>
            <span>I love you so much, it so amazing that</span>

          <p>
            <span>When I think of you, I think of a partner</span>

            <span>guide.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>I don't need to expalin why this poem</span>
            <span>is so special and why the roads we choose made</span>
            <span>the differnece.</span>
          </p>
