          The Road Not Taken

            <span class="long-line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And sorry I could not travel both</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And be one traveler, long I stood</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And looked down one as far as I could</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >To where it bent in the undergrowth;</span

          <p>
            <span class="long-line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >And having perhaps the better claim,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Though as for that the passing there</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Had worn them really about the same,</span
            >

            <span class="long-line">And both that morning equally lay</span

              >In leaves no step had trodden black.</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Oh, I kept the first for another day!</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</span
            ><br /><span class="long-line"
              >I doubted if I should ever come back.</span
